# Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling: Improved Convergence for Variational Inequalities

This is the official implementation of the paper [Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling: Improved Convergence for Variational Inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07148), which was accepted to AISTATS 2024.   
As part of the paper, we provide the Optimizer Module, a library of common optimization algorithms that can be used for solving minimization and minimax problems. 

If you find our code useful consider citing our paper. Also, star-ing the Github Repo is more than welcomed! ðŸŒŸ

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

The Optimizer Module is an efficient and easy-to-customize implementation of common optimization algorithms, allowing you to easily implement your own variant of an optimization method or run experiments in less than 5 lines of code.   
To start using the module and run your experiments, follow the details below.


## Getting Started
To get started make sure you have installed all the prerequisites on your computer and then follow the instructions in the installation section.

### Prerequisites
To compile this implementation you will need:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) library
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting the results
- Python 3.7 or later

You can install the prerequisites with the following command inside the project's folder
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run your experiments!
Run your own experiments using Optimizer module in less than 5 commands:

```python
import optimizer_module as op

# initialize the problem
problem = op.problem(problem_type="quadratic", n=100, d=100, mu=0.1, L=10)

# initialize optimizer object  
optimizer = op.optimizer(problem)

# run your favorite optimization algorithm
solution, relative_error = optimizer.SEG(gamma_1=1e-3, gamma_2=5e-3, x0=np.zeros(200), n_iter=10**6, trials=10, rr=True)
```
Arguments of ```op.problem```:
* problem_type: type of the problem (i.e. quadratic, bilinear, etc.)
* n: number of data samples
* d: dimension of data
* mu: strongly convex parameter (only for strongly convex functions)
* L: Lipschitz parameter for smooth problems  

You can plot the results using:  
```python
op.plot(relative_error, y_label = "Relative Error", title = "Strongly Monotone Game")
```

**Supported Algorithms**: SGDA, SEG, SHGD   
**Supported Problems/Setups**: quadratic, bilinear, convex-concave
